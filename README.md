This is a batch file that shuts down a pc after showing some messages and opening some idle CMDs. Nothing dangerous. I picked an obviously mischievous but funny name that may attract your "victim" on clicking it :P 

You can **run it at your own risk** *(it's nothing harmful but i can't know what may happen though..)* after closing every running program and/or saving any unsaved activity like compilers, notepads, video editors etc so you don't lose anything.
