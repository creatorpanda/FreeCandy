This is a batch file that shuts down a pc after showing some messages and opening some idle CMDs. Nothing dangerous. I picked an obviously mischievous but funny name that may attract your "victim" on clicking it :P 

You can **run it at your own risk** *(it's nothing harmful but i can't know what may happen though..)* after closing every running program and/or saving any unsaved activity like compilers, notepads, video editors etc so you don't lose anything.

Note that closing the command prompt that operates before the shutdown command is given will cancel the imminent shutdown. After the command is given, you do not have enough time to cancel it via "shutdown -a"

In case you don't know what to do: Click on the green "Clone or Download" button, click "Download Zip". Unzip it and run "FreeCandy.bat".
